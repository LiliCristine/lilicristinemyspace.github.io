    <p class="p1">This is a test page. You'll get to know me better, an ordinary but tough girl. 
    I know we all like to praise ourselves LOL so why don't you just give me a break and follow my lead, huh?</p>

    <p class="p2">Currently I'm living in Limerick city - Ireland. I got here last year for an exchange program.
    Can't say I had loads of fun while here because just so you know, the year now is 2021 and we are going through this Covid thing
    and quarantines, and it's just crap.</p>

   <p class="p3"> Apart of that, I met some really special people that actually helped me to get through
    last year and probably will be with me until I move away. I can't thank enough these guys.</p>
